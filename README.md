## About Me

I grew up in Nghe An, a province known for its rich cultural heritage and history. My interest in technology sparked at a young age, and I have been pursuing my passion ever since. Moving to Hanoi provided me with more opportunities to hone my skills and expand my knowledge in mobile development.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging with the tech community. I am always eager to learn and share knowledge, which is why I created this GitHub profile. Feel free to connect with me on social media or check out my projects here on GitHub.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
